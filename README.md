# Connect Four

An implementation of Connect Four playable by humans, AI, or a mix of both. The AI uses the Minimax or Expectimax algorithms to choose moves with Alpha-Beta pruning to improve performance.

## Overview

Players take turns to choose a column to drop their token into where it will rest on top of any other tokens in the column. The first player to match 4 or more of their tokens in a row, horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, wins.
